Hello there! This is my first javaScript app made from scratch.<br>
I'm working on the Odin Project currently.<br>
I'm in the first half of the program to be specific.<br> 
At this point I've learned a little bit of... <br>
1. HTML and CSS
2. Vanilla javaScript
3. Linux (Ubuntu) üêß
4. Chrome Dev Tools 
5. Vim Text Editor
6. Visual Studio Code
I started Odin Project on 27-September-2022.<br>
I'm on my 44th day on my journey and this repository marks my very first javascript app.<br>
I have been doing something similar really, but I think this mini project is where I pull it altogether.<br>

P.S. This file was initially written in Vim and was edited using Visual Studio Code.<br>
