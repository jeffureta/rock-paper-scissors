Hello there! This is my first javaScript app made from scratch.
I'm working on the Odin Project currently.
I'm at the first half of the program to be specific.
At this point I've learned a little bit of...
1. HTML and CSS
2. Vanilla javaScript
3. Linux (Ubuntu)
4. Chrome Dev Tools
5. Vim Text Editor
6. Visual Studio Code
I started Odin Project on 27-September-2022.
I'm on my 44th day on my journey and this repository marks my very first javascript app.
I have been doing something similar really, but I think this mini project is where I pull it altogether.

P.S. This file was initially written in Vim and was edited using Visual Studio Code.
